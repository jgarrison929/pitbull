## 📅 Timeline Summary

| Milestone | Target Date | Actual Date | Status |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| Foundation Complete | Feb 9 | Feb 5 | ✅ 4 days early |
| TimeTracking Shipped | Feb 16 | Feb 5 | ✅ 11 days early |
| Reports/Export Done | Feb 19 | Feb 6 | ✅ 13 days early |
| Contracts Module | - | Feb 7-8 | ✅ Bonus |
| Feature Complete | Feb 21 | Feb 7 | ✅ 14 days early |
| UAT Environment | Feb 21 | TBD | ⏳ Blocked on infra |

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Josh action needed:** Railway/Cloudflare access for demo environment (#119, #120)
2. When unblocked: Deploy demo environment with seeded data
3. Conduct UAT testing with 50+ time entries
4. Validate Vista export with real format
5. Tag v0.50 release

---

**Bottom Line:** All Alpha 0 features are complete and tested. The only remaining work is infrastructure setup for the UAT demo environment, which is blocked on external access that Josh needs to provide.
