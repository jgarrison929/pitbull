## 2026-02-04 Overnight Pitbull run
- Checked PR #100: already merged (main->staging). PR UI shows failed checks but current develop CI is green.
- Verified locally: dotnet test ./Pitbull.sln (Release) passes; frontend npm ci + lint + build passes.
- Noted: frontend repo has package-lock.json and no yarn.lock; yarn install hung; npm is the intended manager (CI uses npm ci).
- Reviewed old failed CI run 21661901142: failures were from missing BidDto/RfiDto before fixes were merged.
