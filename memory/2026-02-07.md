### Hour 4: Overnight Session - Branch Cleanup & Planning (3:00 - 4:00 AM)

#### Session Plan
- **Goal:** Low-risk, high-leverage improvements to Alpha 0
- **Focus:** Branch cleanup, documentation, UAT prep assessment

#### Completed Work

**Branch Cleanup (7 stale branches deleted)**
- `feat/deep-health-checks` - merged, deleted
- `feat/rate-limiting` - merged, deleted  
- `feat/rls-policies` - merged, deleted
- `test/architecture-tests` - merged, deleted
- `security/env-validation` - already integrated, deleted
- `quality/dependabot-security` - already integrated, deleted
- `security/payload-size-limits` - already integrated, deleted

**Issue #122 Updated**
- Updated Alpha 0 delivery timeline with current status
- Documented 546 tests, v0.7.7, all green CI
- Clarified remaining UAT prep is blocked on infra access (#119, #120)

**Production Health Check**
- `pitbull-api-production.up.railway.app/health` → Healthy
- PostgreSQL connection → Healthy
- All endpoints responding

#### Assessment
- **Test count:** 546 (537 unit + 9 integration) - all passing
- **CI:** Green on develop, staging, main
- **UAT prep:** Blocked on Railway/Cloudflare access (needs Josh)
- **RFI module:** Not registered in DbContext - skip handler tests until integrated

#### Notes
- Swagger not accessible in production (404) - may be Railway edge routing or intentional security
- quality/query-validation branch has conflicts - leave for later
- MediatR removal (#118) is significant refactor - not overnight work

#### No New Commits
Focused on cleanup and planning rather than code changes.

#### Stop Condition
UAT environment setup requires infra access Josh needs to provide. Documented blockers clearly.
