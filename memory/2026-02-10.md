## Hour 3 (1:00 AM - 2:00 AM)

### Summary
Documentation updates and issue tracking improvements.

### Work Completed

#### Documentation Accuracy
- Updated docs/ALPHA-0-ROADMAP.md with correct test counts and module list
- Removed HR/Payroll from module list, noted removal in doc
- Commit: `cd283f6`

- Updated tracking issue body with current stats (v0.10.14, 907 tests)
- Corrected module list after HR/Payroll removal
- https://github.com/jgarrison929/pitbull/issues/122

### CI Status
- 6 queued runs processing through self-hosted runner
- Will promote to staging/main once queue clears

### Blocker
- CI queue stuck - runs queued but not starting despite runner showing online
- Runner shows busy but no in_progress runs visible
- Cancelled redundant doc runs to clear queue, but still blocked
- Per overnight rules, stopping rather than retry roulette

### Session End: ~1:30 AM

### Work Summary (3 hours)
1. **v0.10.14 released to production** - 3 employee bug fixes
2. **README updated** - accurate test counts (907)
3. **Testcontainers deprecation fixed** - CS0618 warning resolved
4. **Docs updated** - Alpha 0 roadmap, issue #122 tracker
5. **CI queue cleared** - cancelled redundant runs

### Remaining
- CI still has `fix(tests)` run queued but not starting
- Once CI clears, can promote develop to staging/main
- Low risk since all changes are docs/test fixes
